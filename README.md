# TurtleGraphics
## Installation
First, install the TurtleGraphics following:
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS recommended)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

Second, start mongodb locally by running the `mongod` executable in your mongodb installation (you may need to create a `data` directory or set `--dbpath`).

Then, run `webgme start` from the project root to start. Finally you just have to navigate to `http://localhost:8888` to start using TurtleGraphics!
